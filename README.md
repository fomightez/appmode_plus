# Interactive apps from Jupyter Notebooks

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fomightez/appmode/master?urlpath=apps%2Findex.ipynb)

This repository demonstrates how to create interactive webapps from a Jupyter Notebook.
This is similar to how Shiny apps work in R.

Using the `appmode` Jupyter plugin, a notebook's code will be run, and then only the markdown cells and
code outputs will be shown.

You can check out the `appmode` repository here: https://github.com/oschuett/appmode
